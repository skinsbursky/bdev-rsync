NEWS for rsync 3.0.9 (23 Sep 2011)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.8:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fix a crash bug in checksum scanning when --inplace is used.

    - Fix a hang if a hard-linked file cannot be opened by the sender (e.g.
      if it has no read permission).

    - Fix preservation of a symlink's system xattrs (e.g. selinux) on Linux.

    - Fix a memory leak in the xattr code.

    - Fixed a bug with --delete-excluded when a filter merge file has a rule
      that specifies a receiver-only side restriction.

    - Fix a bug with the modifying of unwritable directories.

    - Fix --fake-super's interaction with --link-dest same-file comparisons.

    - Fix the updating of the curr_dir buffer to avoid a duplicate slash.

    - Fix the directory permissions on an implied dot-dir when using --relative
      (e.g. /outside/path/././send/path).

    - Fixed some too-long sleeping instances when using --bwlimit.

    - Fixed when symlink ownership difference-checking gets compiled into
      unchanged_attrs().

    - Improved the socket-error reporting when multiple protocols fail.

    - Fixed a case where a socket error could reference just-freed memory.

    - Failing to use a password file that was specified on the command-line is
      now a fatal error.

    - Fix the non-root updating of directories that don't have the read and/or
      execute permission.

    - Make daemon-excluded file errors more error-like.

    - Fix a compilation issue on older C compilers (due to a misplaced var
      declaration).

    - Make configure avoid finding socketpair on cygwin.

    - Avoid trying to reference SO_BROADCAST if the OS doesn't support it.

    - Fix some issues with the post-processing of the man pages.

    - Fixed the user home-dir handling in the support/lsh script.

    - Some minor manpage improvements.
