This file contains usage examples of new ProfitBricks's rsync features, such as
"--copy_devices", "--offset" and "--file-bwlimit".

1) Copy via SSH from another node:

rsync -avzW -4 --inplace --copy-devices --offset=4m --file-bwlimit=100m <remote_node>:<remote device> <local device>

where:
	--inplace	- devices content copying is supported only if this
			  option is set
	--copy-devices	- instructs rsync, that device content have to be
			  copied instead of the device file itself.
	--offset	- file offset to sync from/to. IOW, the data will be
			  synchronized starting from this offset. Before this
			  offset data will remain unchanged.
	--file-bwlimit	- file read/write bandwidth limit.

	-W		- copy whole file. Without this option rsync will read
			  both files, calculate checksums and copy only
			  non-matching blocks. In case of fast network it makes
			  no sense.
	-4		- use IPv4 protocol.

2) Copy by using Rsync server, started on data source:

Here is an example of rsync configuration file, allowing rsync deamon to share
all the /dev/ contents in read-only mode:

uid = root
gid = root
use chroot = yes
read only = yes
pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid

[dev]
       path = /dev
       comment = whole devices area

Apart of it, there is a global configuration file, usually located at /etc/default/rsync.
Options in this file have to be changes as follows:

RSYNC_ENABLE=true
RSYNC_CONFIG_FILE=<path to rsync configuration file, specified as above>
RSYNC_OPTS='--inplace --copy-devices --offset=4m --file-bwlimit=100m'

In case of using rsync daemon, client have to copy block device contents as
follows:

rsync -avzW -4 --inplace --copy-devices --offset=4m --file-bwlimit=100m rsync://<remote_node><remote device> <local device>
