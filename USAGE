Usage examples of new ProfitBricks features

1) General connection via SSH:

rsync -avzW --inplace --copy-devices --offset=4m --file-bwlimit=100m <local device> 192.168.49.149:<remote device>

where:
	--inplace	- devices content copying is supported only if this
			  option is set
	--copy-devices	- instructs rsync, that device content have to be
			  copied instead of the device file itself.
	--offset	- file offset to sync from/to. IOW, the data will be
			  synchronized starting from this offset. Before this
			  offset data will remain unchanged.
	--file-bwlimit	- file read/write bandwidth limit.

	-W		- copy whole file. Without this option rsync will read
			  both files, calculate checksums and copy only
			  non-matching blocks. In case of fast network it makes
			  no sense.
